# Web server for image classification


## Download the repository

Use git to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unica-isde/flask-classification-2022-E
```

And install the requirements with 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additional requirements:
* Redis
* Docker

## Configuration

Configure the service by editing the file `config.py`.

## Prepare the resources

It is recommended to pre-download images and models before running 
the server. This is to avoid unnecessary waits for users.

Run `prepare_images.py` and `prepare_models.py`. Models will 
be stored in your PyTorch cache directory, while the path for 
the image directory can be found in the `config.py` file. 

## Usage

### Run locally

To run the code without containers, it is sufficient to run 
separately the `runserver.py` script, and the `worker.py` 
script. The worker will process jobs stored in the queue. 
In order for the queue to work, you should have `redis`  
installed and running (specify port in `config.py`).
